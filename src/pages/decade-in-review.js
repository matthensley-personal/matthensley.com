      <strong>This was the decade that got me back into music.</strong> Through happenstance, effort, and the natural progression of things, I've reinvigorated the connection to music fandom I developed in my late teens and lost touch with in my mid-20's. </p>

      <p>When I got to college in the early 2000's I was hungry for culture, and in the first few years I was exposed to a lot of new stuff from new friends and dorm fileservers. But after moving up to Portland in 2007 I was feeling stuck on my collection. Every year a few new albums from old favorites would come out, but rarely would those eclipse past glories. I found myself spending most of my music-related efforts shopping the "skuf" bin at Music Millenium, buying $2-3 CD copies of albums I had only ever pirated (having come of age in the Napster era), treading water in my listening habits.</p>
        <p
          style={{
            ...scale(-1 / 5),
            display: `block`,
            marginBottom: rhythm(1),
          }}
        >In 2009, we bought a house and I got a record player. I had a moderate selection of cheap copies of 60's/70's vinyl + some novelty hits, but I had never in my life been someone to routinely PAY for new music / maintain a physical collection. This helped spur a new appreciation for the physical medium and start paying attention to new releases to start building a small library. In 2010, we got a car that had a USB input and I started commuting a bit. This meant loading as many mp3's as I could onto my iPod touch and shuffling my way through rush hour traffic on the 205. This helped a bit as dedicated time to listen, but like many in that era, I had lost touch with the idea of an "album" as something to digest and appreciate. 2010 and 2011 were also filled with adult stuff, like house projects, getting married, settling into jobs and new friend groups, etc., all the while getting more and more restless with my day-to-day soundtrack.</p>
        <p
          style={{
            ...scale(-1 / 5),
            display: `block`,
            marginBottom: rhythm(1),
          }}
        >Then in 2012, things broke wide open. We went to our first Pickathon that summer, which has now become one of my favorite weekends of the year and most trusted sources of new music. Because there are often four things happening at any given time, there is the freedom to drop in on something you wouldnâ€™t normally see live, and because the festival curation is so spot on, everything is on the table / worth checking out. Looking back over the decade, over half of my top 50 artists have played Pickathon in that same time span, which is pretty incredible. With that new influence and my burgeoning awareness of online music communities, I could sense a whole world booming around me that I couldn't find my way into, and in a fit of desperation I forced myself to sit down and listen to 100 albums ranked highly on various music blog year-end lists. I have now repeated this routine with only slight variation in each subsequent year- sometimes listening to roughly 250 albums in a year in order to create that final list. </p>
        <p
          style={{
            ...scale(-1 / 5),

            marginBottom: rhythm(1),
          }}
        ><strong>Since then, things haven't really stopped.</strong> I keep up as best I can (for a father of two) with the weekly releases, music blogs etc and try and keep my ear to the ground on what's coming up. Invaluable in this process is the <a href="https://aquariumdrunkard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aquarium Drunkard blog</a>, a <a href="http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few</a> <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trusted</a> <a href="https://www.noquarter.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">record</a> <a href="https://deadoceans.com/">labels</a>, a <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonpwoodbury" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handful</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/currincy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/totalvibration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/en_cohen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writers</a> on Twitter, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All Songs Considered</a> podcast, and of course, the annual <a href="https://www.pickathon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pickathon</a> lineup. I try not to be too deliberate about anything anymore- try to follow threads when they present themselves and not force myself to sit through something that isn't working for me. Each year, I'm recalibrating my approach, adjusting where I put in effort and where I go with the flow. Now I have "acquired" enough bands that their subsequent releases are enough to keep me busy without being forced to find something truly new, which is both a blessing and a curse. Throughout this process I have tried to chronicle my reactions as "reviews" without too much forethought or self-awareness, but now looking back on my comments, I frequently cringe. I'm grateful to have finally realized I am no critic- I like to share what I like and should let the music speak for itself as much as possible. I have run out of descriptors and no longer feel the need to try to rewrite things that someone else has said more eloquently.</p>

        >I don't know where things will go from here- if at the end of 2029 I'll have a similar story to tell. Maybe I'll be living in my musical past, complaining about what the kids are listening to nowadays. Maybe then will be the time to start working my way backwards, filling in gaps of influences and underground / underappreciated stuff from the 70's. In some ways, I'm trying to embrace the idea of getting jaded on my current cycles and finding a new way in. Sometimes you gotta break it to fix it. It's also not lost on me that as the breadth of voices and perspectives in the music world expands, this list is almost comically comprised of white dudes with long hair who play guitar. I do not apologize for this, but I sure as hell don't celebrate it. Who knows what I'll be into- the only thing I can really hope for is that I'm liking what I'm listening to.</p>

        <p>Thanks to Pickathon's relentless dedication to recording, I can go back and re-live one of my favorite musical moments of the decade. Sweden's own Daniel Norgren, on the Treeline Stage in 2016. It's Friday at Pickathon, and things are just getting started. He's relatively unknown (if not entirely?) in the US, and this is his first US performance ever. The set is relatively subdued- interesting, pleasant, but you can see at the start most are sitting down cross-legged soaking up the lightly accompanied accordion, piano, and blues guitar. I'm somewhere in there too- up relatively close (as I tend to be), though I've looked for myself many times in this video. I'll let the video speak for itself, but when this set was over, I (and nearly everyone else lucky enough to be present) prioritized his next two shows at the festival over everything else, and those 3 shows from that weekend will live among my favorite musical memories.</p>
