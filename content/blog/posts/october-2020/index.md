###Take Me Away###
I love to read Wikipedia pages about moderately sized communities that live in states of isolation. I think about Perth a lot. I’ve never been to Australia and don’t really know anything about it, but the physical location of Perth is fascinating to me. It’s in the middle of nowhere, across the continent on one side from all other significant civilization and across vast seas from everywhere else, but it has hospitals, universities, all of the things that make a modern city. Or even Edmonton- they have a professional sports team (a high bar for a city) and are seemingly surrounded by hundreds of miles of arboreal forest in every direction.

I end up looking at tourist / scientist communities on Greenland on Google maps street view from time to time, or fantasizing about Longyearben Norway, where it’s against the law to leave your house without a polar bear rifle.

But people live there! Thousands of people. It reminds me of the Mitch Hedberg joke about wanting to go to Everest and hang out at basecamp.
>I wanna mountain climb just to hang out at basecamp. You grow a beard, you drink hot chocolate. "Hey, you goin' to the top?".. "Soon..."

I kind of want to go to the Antarctica depicted in [Encounters at the End of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encounters_at_the_End_of_the_World) and never go outside. I guess it's probably like being on a cruise ship...

When Emily and I finished college, we traveled around Western Europe for a couple of months. To start and finish the trip, we were connected to a friend of a family friend in London who graciously put us up for a few nights and showed us the city. Nearly 15 years gone by now, I’d tried a few times recently to track him down online, despite not knowing his last name or anything about him because that’s another thing I do for fun. This month, through a mostly unremarkable turn of events, I found him. I found him, and the architecture firm he is a partner in, and as confirmation there was a photo of him in an article about a design competition project somehow relating to the island of Tristan de Cunha, which I had never heard of.

It turns out that the island is part of the most remote archipelago in the world! There is no landing strip for airplanes! Fishing boats from South Africa make it there less than 10 times a year. 250 people live there.
