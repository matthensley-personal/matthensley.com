###Take Me Away###
I love to read Wikipedia pages about moderately sized communities that live in states of isolation. I think about Perth a lot. I’ve never been to Australia and don’t really know anything about it, but the physical location of Perth is fascinating to me. It’s in the middle of nowhere, across the continent on one side from all other significant civilization and across vast seas from everywhere else, but it has hospitals, universities, all of the things that make a modern city. Or even Edmonton- they have a professional sports team (a high bar for a city) and are seemingly surrounded by hundreds of miles of arboreal forest in every direction.

I end up looking at tourist / scientist communities on Greenland on Google maps street view from time to time, or fantasizing about Longyearben Norway, where it’s against the law to leave your house without a polar bear rifle.

But people live there! Thousands of people. It reminds me of the Mitch Hedberg joke about wanting to go to Everest and hang out at basecamp.
>I wanna mountain climb just to hang out at basecamp. You grow a beard, you drink hot chocolate. "Hey, you goin' to the top?".. "Soon..."

I kind of want to go to the Antarctica depicted in [Encounters at the End of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encounters_at_the_End_of_the_World) and never go outside. I guess it's probably like being on a cruise ship...

When Emily and I finished college, we traveled around Western Europe for a couple of months. To start and finish the trip, we were connected to a friend of a family friend in London who graciously put us up for a few nights and showed us the city. Nearly 15 years gone by now, I’d tried a few times recently to track him down online, despite not knowing his last name or anything about him because that’s another thing I do for fun. This month, through a mostly unremarkable turn of events, I found him. I found him, and the architecture firm he is a partner in, and as confirmation there was a photo of him in an article about a design competition project somehow relating to the island of Tristan de Cunha, which I had never heard of.

It turns out that the island is part of the most remote archipelago in the world! There is no landing strip for airplanes! Fishing boats from South Africa make it there less than 10 times a year. 250 people live there.

##The Monthly Stuff##

*Note: One of the main reasons I started this thing up was that I felt like I came across a lot of great stuff this month. I don't want to overload this first one, so I'm gonna have to put some October stuff in November, or save it for a rainy day.*

####What I'm Reading####
I started it in September, but I primarily read (and finished) Frank Herbert's classic *Dune* this month. I started it because I had always meant to read it and wanted to make sure I finished it before the movie came out. Then the movie got delayed a year, and THEN I found out that the movie is only half of the book, which I kind of detest. I've watched half of the David Lynch one, and will follow it up with Jodorowsky's Dune.

The book was very much in my wheelhouse, and I got into it. I've got *Dune: Messiah* gathering dust on my nightstand right now, but I'll probably pick it back up in November.

####This Month's Music####
October is traditionally a huge release and tour month, and while clearly tours ain't happening, albums are being released like hotcakes. I took a few months off from caring about new music but this month has snapped me back in. Am I still nearly exclusively listening to Neil Young? Yes (more on that sometime later), but these are a few albums that came out this month that really tickled my fancy.

#####The Mountain Goats - Getting Into Knives#####
#####Mary Lattimore - Silver Ladders#####
#####Cut Worms - Nobody Lives Here Anymore#####
