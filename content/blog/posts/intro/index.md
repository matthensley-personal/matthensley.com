I’m writing this with less than a week to go before Election Day, 2020. I wanted to get this first one out before, before whatever happens happens and consumes us all. So hello and welcome to whatever this is and I hope it finds you well.

I am here writing the most troubling thing I can think of: a first blog post. It makes me shudder. There is a genuine stress in thinking about phrases like “welcome to my new blog” and “I’m going to write about blah blah blah”. It’s mostly because not only have I seen it before, I’ve DONE it before... like so many others I’ve been so infatuated with the IDEA of having a blog that I thought that meant I should have one. And always months later, after I quietly shuffled away that first post, tried to convince myself it was the platform that was the problem and not my own rampant hubris.

But finally after a year or two of absence, I’ve moved on and created a new, better platform, so: welcome to my new blog. My first post, like all good first posts, is an overlong description of why unlike all past failures, this blog will be worth reading, consistent, and meaningful.

The intention (which may shift) is to cap off each month with a brief thought or two and then catalog the things I’m reading, listening to, watching etc for anyone who is interested and for myself in retrospect. I think it will have a positive effect on my awareness throughout the month of what I am enjoying and hopefully at some point lead to meaningful interactions with you, my esteemed readers.

####Ok, that's enough.####
