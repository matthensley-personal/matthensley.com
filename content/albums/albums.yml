  description: <p>This album will always remind me of my friend Cody, released at a time when my garage was full of instruments (rather than strollers) and we would bang around on weekend days trying to keep the feeling alive. One of these songs was a staple of those jams (the rest far too difficult for me to play), and this album is a psychedelic rock masterpiece.</p>

  description: <p>I don't claim to have been along for the ride- this was my first album of his that spoke to me, but I've since gone back and found things I love. The release of this was a perfect trick for me- two great songs preceding a physical release months before the album would be available for streaming. Nothing finer than taking the leap on a record you haven't heard yet and having it pay off. Since then I've gone back to explore his work with the magnificent Richard Swift (RIP) and had the great pleasure of seeing him up close and personal at Pickathon last year.</p>

  description: <p>Karl Blau is a true artist who is a master of many things, but this favorite work of mine by a long stretch is a straightforward collection of 70's country(ish) covers that he produces masterfully- his curation of the songs among the most important skills on display. I hadn't heard most of their original incarnations before, and he's opened me up to a whole wide world. Heavy memories of playing this for my mom as she recovered from an intense surgery a few months after it came out, and glad it was something I had to share.</p>

  description: <p>One of many artists on this list that I first really got to know at Pickathon, in his case my first one. He opened with the 10 minute album closer (my favorite from the record) and extended the riffs, staring off into space like there was no audience. Shaky voiced, slightly twanged, jangly rock for the ages.</p>

  description: <p>This stuff sneaks up on me- I've had a few songs burrow their way into my soul and become a part of me (namely the 12 minute intro track to 2013's "Blood Oaths of the New Blues") but I felt like Cipper Ship is a high-water mark and I had "One Can Only Love" in my head for months.

  description: <p>These guys blew the door to metal open for me- incorporating more than a touch of post-rock and probably a little emo into some mostly bright black metal, it's a breath of fresh air every time I listen. Favorite memory of this was a late night drive across the state solo to help set up for a friend's wedding with this blaring in my ears to keep me awake. Bucket list show, one of the few bands from this list I didn't get a chance to see live.</p>

  description: <p>I got into Yo La Tengo in college, and really found my way in for I'm Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass, but I mostly loved the less-noisy half of their songs. This album is all right at my level of dissonance, especially the opening track which has to be on a short list of my favorite songs of the decade. An anthem for unsure times.</p>

  description: <p>I liked their highly reviewed 2012 album, which marked a slightly less lo-fi incarnation of the band, and this follows that trend ever so slightly. My favorite album by a band is usually the first one where they really figure out what is working for them, but before they are just trying to exploit that thing. This is that album for me, mostly folky groovers with a few extended jams.<p>

  description: <p>This was my number one album of 2012, and I'd love to put them higher on the list but they disappeared from the earth (for now) I think due to some pretty personal tragedy. I hadn't heard any of it until my first Pickathon and they happened to be the act before someone I was waiting super early in advance for at The Woods Stage (maybe Blitzen Trapper?). One of my favorite performances of that year, and this album still defines the type of sound that I have been seeking since then- inventive, traditional, folky, but not afraid to get a little noisy. Hope to get more from them again one day.</p>

Sometimes buying something you've only heard once or maybe not even on a hunch can be way more satisfying than listening to it 10 times and knowing you love it. The risk paid off, and these guys put on a feel-good live show to bring the house down.</p>

It was a day or two after the Sandy Hook shooting and everyone was still a bit woozy from trying to figure out how to deal with that.

This album rips and I put it on all the time, a studio masterpiece.</p>

Not sure where my bias was- or if I have changed and now like things I didn't. I think I wasn't really aware of them until Father John Misty kind of started happening and I grouped them in with his whole shtick. Anyway, I'm sorry, they're really great and this album is an all-timer.</p>
