One of these songs was a staple of those jams (the rest far too difficult for me to play), and this album is a psychedelic rock masterpiece.</p>

  description: <p>I don't claim to have been along for the ride- this was my first album of his that spoke to me, but I've since gone back and found things I love. The release of this was a perfect trick for me- two great songs preceding a physical release months before the album would be available for streaming. Nothing finer than taking the leap on a record you haven't heard yet and having it pay off. Since then I've gone back to explore his work with the magnificent Richard Swift (RIP) and had the great pleasure of seeing him up close and personal at Pickathon last year.</p>

  description: <p>Karl Blau is a true artist who is a master of many things, but this favorite work of mine by a long stretch is a straightforward collection of 70's country(ish) covers that he produces masterfully- his curation of the songs among the most important skills on display. I hadn't heard most of their original incarnations before, and he's opened me up to a whole wide world. Heavy memories of playing this for my mom as she recovered from an intense surgery a few months after it came out, and glad it was something I had to share.</p>

I hadn't heard any of it until my first Pickathon and they happened to be the act before someone I was waiting super early in advance for at The Woods Stage (maybe Blitzen Trapper?). One of my favorite performances of that year, and this album still defines the type of sound that I have been seeking since then- inventive, traditional, folky, but not afraid to get a little noisy.

One day I was sitting in my living room and a light bulb went off, and sure enough, there was Phil right on the cover of that one too. I popped onto Discogs and found just how many of my favorite albums he's touched in some way (and even more since then) as parts of DeYarmond Edison, Hiss Golden Messenger, and laying down studio guitar tracks for everyone I hold near and dear.

  description: <p>On my second full day of my first Pickathon, I sought shelter in the Galaxy Barn in the heat of the day and Doug Paisley happened to be playing. I was sleepy, and it was so downtempo and his low, heartbroken voice was simultaneously putting me to sleep and bringing me down because it felt too real. Later that year, I came across his (then) most recent album and fell in love with it. It's common for me to like all of an artist's songs, but inevitably have a few that I love and a few I could take or leave. I would not "leave" any one of his songs, off any one of his albums. A true master.</p>

  description: <p>I'm not sure anyone shaped indie music this decade in the way Justin Vernon did- he was a part of so many projects / collectives, pursued endless collaboration, lifted his compatriots to a higher level, and inspired countless musicians to follow his path. You get an album like "For Emma..." pretty rarely, but the way his art grew and shifted after that is truly special. It would have been so easy to just be the "cabin breakup album" guy and ride that wave to a certain type of success, but he took a harder path and has grown, taken risks, and expanded his view with every new release. This sophomore album is the biggest testament to that- it's so uniquely his, defiant of expectations and brilliant in a way that is as satisfying artistically as it is sonically.</p>

  description: <p>Hard to pick an album among this decade's work- there are four that I could pick depending on the mood, but the opening track to this album I think I can just lock in as my favorite song of the decade. I realized early on that a surprising number of my favorite albums start with their strongest song and that song is often upwards of 7 minutes long. The (nearly) titular opener is 10 minutes of contemplative guitar bliss, and I go back to it all the time. Back in my running days, I would mostly listen to podcasts due to the complication with tempo and pace for a lot of music, but I always made sure that song was in the mix and there was nothing like it coming on and just letting the road open up ahead of me.</p>

  description: <p>Felt like a bit of a broken record sometimes in my year end lists in the last few years- and I don't really know what to say now beyond this is my jam. KM isn't the only person doing this type of thing, but none of it speaks to me like this does. It's simultaneously simple and decievingly deep. It's exactly calibrated for my enjoyment, and I am so thankful to have had these 5 albums to help me process the 2010s. Really and truly has been the defining music of my decade.</p>
